# Database Scripts
<!-- Enter a description for the repository -->

This repository holds a collection of scripts that aid in working with the project database using Prisma. It should also be considered the single-source-of-truth for the deployed database, and contains the migration files, schema file, and scripts necessary to create and seed the database.

## Documentation
